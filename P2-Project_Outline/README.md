## Submission Instructions

### Overview
For the final project, I am creating a golf handicap calculator. This will allow for individual users to register and sign in
to the site. Within a user account, the user will be able to submit their latest round along with the course name, slope, and 
rating to calculate their handicap for the round. The page will also keep a running total for their overall handicap. Users will
also be able to see a chart with all of their rounds logged with all details.
